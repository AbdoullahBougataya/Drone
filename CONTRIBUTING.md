# Contributing to QCFA

Thank you for your interest in QCFA and for taking the time to contribute to this project. üôå QCFA is a project by developers for developers and there are a lot of ways you can contribute.

## Code of conduct

Contributors are expected to adhere to the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Prerequisites for the contributors

Contributors should have knowledge of C++, Arduino and git since the project work heavily depends on them.
We encourage Contributors to set up QCFA for local development and play around with the code and tests to get more comfortable with the project.

# <a name="contributing">General Contribution Flow</a>

## <a name="commit-signing">Signing-off on Commits (Developer Certificate of Origin)</a>

To contribute to this project, you must agree to the Developer Certificate of
Origin (DCO) for each commit you make. The DCO is a simple statement that you,
as a contributor, have the legal right to make the contribution.

See the [DCO](https://developercertificate.org) file for the full text of what you must agree to
and how it works [here](https://github.com/probot/dco#how-it-works).
To signify that you agree to the DCO for contributions, you simply add a line to each of your
git commit messages:

```
Signed-off-by: John Smith <john.smith@example.com>
```

In most cases, you can add this signoff to your commit automatically with the
`-s` or `--signoff` flag to `git commit`. You must use your real name and a reachable email
address (sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions). An example of signing off on a commit:

```
$ commit -s -m ‚Äúmy commit message w/signoff‚Äù
```

To ensure all your commits are signed, you may choose to add this alias to your global `.gitconfig`:

_~/.gitconfig_

```
[alias]
  amend = commit -s --amend
  cm = commit -s -m
  commit = commit -s
```
